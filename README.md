# Machine Learning Journey Notebooks
Welcome to the Machine Learning Journey Notebooks repository :)

In 2019, I set myself a goal to dig into the awesome field of machine learning.
I believe that it is a future of computing and a very valuable skill.

I am a software engineer mostly interested in architecture so this will be completely new for me.
I decided to create a notebook for each topic I'm gonna learn in order to create myself
a reference point so I can refresh any topic easily in the future.
